# WantADog

AS A hopeful pet owner or bored web developer<br>
I WANT random images of dogs with random names<br>
So I CAN make a list of possible kinds of dogs <br>
to adopt and what to name them<br>
OR BE entertained<br>

## Description
[WantADog](https://abnertor.github.io/WantADog/) is a library of doggo pictures and random names to help users find the best doggo-doggo name combinations. The user can click through randomly generated names and dog images, as well as retrieve new name-dog combinations. The user can also save name-dog combinations into a favorites carousel. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript and jQuery. The favorited name-dog combinations are stored in `localStorage` and are accesible even after page refresh. Name data is retrieved by making `fetch()` calls to the [Namey! API](https://namey.muffinlabs.com/) and the dog images are retrieved from [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/).

### Features
* When the page loads, a random name and dog image are displayed. The favorites carousel displays a placeholder spinning doge image.
* When the user clicks the "Name" button a new doggo name is retrieved.
* When the user clicks the "Doggo" button a new doggo image is retrieved.
* When the user clicks the "New Combo" button a new combination of doggo name and doggo image are retrieved.
* When the user clicks the "Save Current Combo" button, the current doggo name/image combination  is saved to Favorites and stored as an object in an array in `localStorage`
* When the user clicks the "Prev" and "Next" buttons, they can click through their favorite dog/name combinations, which are stored in `localStorage`.
* When the user clicks the "Clear" button to clear previously saved favorites, `localStorage` is cleared.
* Saving duplicate favorites of the same dog name-image combination is prevented

### Future Developments
* Adding a "share" function so that name-doggo combinations can be downloaded and/or shared with friends and family
* Improving Mobile UI/UX
